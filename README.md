# CTF-Writeups

CTF challenges require you to investigate weaknesses, exploit vulnerabilities, and promote reverse engineering of given executables or web applications to get hold of a string, also known as a flag. When submitting the correct flag, you gain points used for global comparison between players.

This repository contains all CTF writeups I've created.
