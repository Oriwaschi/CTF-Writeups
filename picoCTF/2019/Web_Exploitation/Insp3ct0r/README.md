# Insp3ct0r

Points: 50

## Problem
> Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/` [(link)](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/63975/) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:63975

## Hints
> 1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
> 2. There's 3 parts

## Solution

To get started, we get a pretty boring webpage.

Searching for `robots.txt` tells us that there is none.
So this challenge must be about examining the imported files and the page's source code.

Examining the source code gives us the first part of the flag:

`<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3 -->`


In the head tag, 2 custom files are being imported:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mycss.css">
<script type="application/javascript" src="myjs.js"></script>
```

Checking `mycss.css` gives us part #2 of the flag: `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t`

Examining `myjs.js` gives us the last piece of the flag: `_lucky?d3db9182}`

## Flag

`picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?d3db9182}`
